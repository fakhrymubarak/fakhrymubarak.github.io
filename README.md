### GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment with the correct base path. The 404 errors you were experiencing have been resolved by:

#### What Was Fixed

1. **Base Path Configuration**: Added `base: `/` to `vite.config.ts` for production builds
2. **Service Worker Paths**: Updated service worker registration to use the correct base path
3. **Asset Paths**: All static assets (icons, manifest, etc.) now use the correct base path
4. **HTML Paths**: Updated all hardcoded paths in `index.html` and `manifest.json`

#### Key Changes Made

- **Vite Config**: Added dynamic base path configuration
- **Service Worker**: Updated to handle subdirectory deployment
- **Static Assets**: All paths now correctly prefixed with `/`
- **TypeScript**: Added proper environment type definitions

#### Deployment Process

1. **Automatic**: The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment
2. **Manual**: Use the provided deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter 404 errors after deployment:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check Service Worker**: Clear service worker cache in browser dev tools
3. **Verify Base Path**: Ensure `vite.config.ts` has the correct base path
4. **Check Asset Paths**: Verify all static assets use the correct base path
